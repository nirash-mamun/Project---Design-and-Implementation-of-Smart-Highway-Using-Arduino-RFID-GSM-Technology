# Project---Design-and-Implementation-of-Smart-Highway-Using-Arduino-RFID-GSM-Technology
There has been an alarming rise in road accidents, significantly highway accidents, in many  countries including Bangladesh over the past few years. Nearly 1.3 million people die in road  crashes each year, on average 3287 deaths a day globally.To reduce the number of accidents,  it is important, making analysis the causes &amp; behavior of accident and the highway more  safer by introducing the latest technology in the communication of road &amp; vehicle.  This paper discusses the present scenarios of highway accident in Bangladesh and figure out  some reasons behind the accidents. Real time notification between driver and road is a major  issue to discuss and need a smart automatic technique to design this system.  In this paper, vehicle speed notification system for Smart highway as a solution to solve the  over speed problem and reducing road accident, are discussed.The number of accidents  caused by over speed, can be reduces by giving auto-feedback to the driver about the road  status. Also in this paper, discuss About  how we can make security system for vehicles and  presengers by using GSM technology for highway vehicles, and how to Control highways  accident &amp; roads traffic. Intregrating the Arduino, RFID &amp;GSM technology, a  prototype  device is designed, implemented and tested for highway in this project
